This activity is an exploration in setting up an API Project created with JavaScript, with user-related services such as Registration, Login, and User-authentication/entrance to a Protected Route. There is an additional Product Service for simulation of microservice, which is usable in Fetching Products. Both are tested and explored in an interactive manner using Postman.

Pair: Almario, Via Ysabelle B.
